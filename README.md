# randPhrase
A C++ based "art" piece which generates random phrases and displays them to the screen, with some accompanying metadata.

Version 1.0:
 - Pulls words from a dictionary file (not included in repo) and puts them in a map, along with an associated vector.
 - Vector will be populated with a pair, including an index to another word, and a double weight. These links are set as the program generates phrases.
 - Links are somewhat favored in phrase generation.
 - Generation uses some math to randomly place commas (should appear every 2 - 6 words), keep sentences to a reasonably short length (8 to 15 words), and alternate between short words and long words.
 - Currently it is not possible for certain phrases to be generated by context, a single string of words will be weighted for.
